# Introduction

The following is a fork from Zephyr‚Ñ¢ Mechanical Keyboard (ZMK) Firmware taken at
commit `3f6841c95ff9a82658576828895ebcba1b0a5f86`.

[Board_Name]-CONFIG contains all the config files for the particular board, currently I only have configurations for the [Kyria v3](https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-rev3?srsltid=AfmBOorhClEbHRVbltb91rraPOLW9f0kI1bEfEyJ_WuGiZBzGlFUNtAQ).

## Building

For a general guide on how to build without using the GitHub actions please refer to [ZMK Building Flashing](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/build-flash).

My current process involves:

```
west build -s app/ -d build/right -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="kyria_rev3_right nice_view_adapter nice_view" -DZMK_CONFIG="zmk-config/config"
```

Keep in mind if building a new board or making changing like a new shield to include the pristine flag [(1)](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/build-flash#pristine-building)

## Build Environment

My build environment is managed by NIX, please refer to my repo for the shell environment [ZEPHER ENV](https://github.com/MatthewWinnan/nixos-configs/tree/master/shells/zypher)

This is invoked using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and including the following lines within the .envrc file:
`use flake /path/to/flakes#zypher`

Then use `direnv allow` to create the development environment within NIX.

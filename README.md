# Introduction

The following is a fork from Zephyr‚Ñ¢ Mechanical Keyboard (ZMK) Firmware taken at
commit `3f6841c95ff9a82658576828895ebcba1b0a5f86`.

All of my board specific configurations are maintained in their separate config files with their respective Nix devShell.

This repo does fetch them so I can test builds here too, however the intended way to build a board is to clone the corresponding config
repo.

## Building

For a general guide on how to build without using the GitHub actions please refer to [ZMK Building Flashing](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/build-flash).

My current process involves:

```
west build -p -d build/left -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="kyria_rev3_left nice_view_adapter kyria_nice_view"
-DZMK_CONFIG="/home/matthew/ZYPHER/zmk-facehugger/config/kyria_zmk_config/config"
```

Keep in mind if building a new board or making changing like a new shield to include the pristine flag [(1)](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/build-flash#pristine-building)

## Build Environment

My build environment is managed by NIX, please refer to my repo for the shell environment [ZEPHER ENV](https://github.com/MatthewWinnan/nixos-configs/tree/master/shells/zypher)

This is invoked using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and including the following lines within the .envrc file:
`use flake /path/to/flakes#zypher`

Then use `direnv allow` to create the development environment within NIX.
